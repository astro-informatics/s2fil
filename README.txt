                          S2FIL PACKAGE
                 Optimal filtering on the sphere
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION 
     This package provides functionality to support optimal filtering
     on the sphere. Optimal directional matched filters (MF) and scale
     adaptive filters (SAF) may be constructed from a template and
     stochastic background process. Functionality is incorporated also
     to filter a sky data map using an optimal filter and to detect
     compact objects using a naive thresholding strategy.
